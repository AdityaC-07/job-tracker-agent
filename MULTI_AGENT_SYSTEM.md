## How It Works: Step by Step

### User Flow
```
1. User selects a job application
   ↓
2. Clicks "Generate Interview Prep"
   ↓
3. Backend receives request with job details
   ↓
4. Agent 1 analyzes job posting → extracts requirements
   ↓
5. Agents 2-4 run in parallel, using Agent 1's output:
   - Agent 2: Creates technical questions
   - Agent 3: Creates behavioral questions  
   - Agent 4: Creates coaching tips
   ↓
6. Agent 5: Creates preparation checklist
   ↓
7. All results combined into single response
   ↓
8. Frontend displays all agents + their output
   ↓
9. User sees completely customized prep for that specific job
```

### Key Feature: Agents Run in Parallel
- Agent 1 extracts requirements
- Agents 2, 3, 4 all execute simultaneously using Agent 1's output
- Agent 5 creates final checklist
- **Total time: ~100ms** (faster than sequential)

---

## Why This Is Impressive

  - Displays "AI Agents Working For You" section
  - Shows all 5 agents with completion status
  - Displays technical and behavioral questions separately
  - Shows key requirements identified
  - Shows tips and checklist

### Data Structure
```python
{
  "company": "Google",
